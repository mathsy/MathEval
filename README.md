# MathEval
A GUI Chess Engine built on "Skotz" ehich selfoptimes itself.
It is writte in C#.

It is in early stage, but it runs stable.

I train my engine regulary, so the new weights will always be available here. 


# Initialize weights
To initialize the weights, download the .txt file and rename it to "result.txt" in the engines folder.

# What does the weights file name mean

In original the name will be "weights-gen-xxxx", where xxxx means the number of games it played.

# This engine is built on Skotz
